 # Phased Execution Plan

 This document outlines a multi-phase roadmap to implement the audit recommendations in a prioritized manner.

 ## Phase 1: Documentation Consolidation (Sprint 1)
 - **Consolidate READMEs**: Merge duplicate top-level and sub-READMEs into centralized `docs/` directory.
 - **Archive outdated docs**: Move deprecated or overlapping markdown files to an `archive/` folder.
 - **Update references**: Ensure top-level README links point to consolidated docs.

 ## Phase 2: Secret Management & Validation (Sprint 2)
 - **Env var checks**: Add startup validation for required environment variables (`.env`).
 - **Secret linter**: Integrate `secretlint` or equivalent to prevent accidental leak of credentials.

 ## Phase 3: CI/CD Security Enhancements (Sprint 3)
 - **Pin Action versions**: Fix versions for Trivy, Bun setup, and other GH Actions.
 - **Dependency audit**: Add `bun audit` or `npm audit --audit-level=high` step.
 - **Coverage gates**: Enforce minimum coverage thresholds in CI.

 ## Phase 4: Pre-Commit Hooks & Script Linting (Sprint 4)
 - **Pre-commit config**: Introduce `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to run ESLint, Prettier, Shellcheck.
 - **Shellcheck**: Lint all deployment and helper scripts.

 ## Phase 5: Version Management & Releases (Sprint 5)
 - **Lock CI tool versions**: Standardize on tested versions for Bun, GH Actions, Docker base images.
 - **Release process**: Define a uniform release workflow across CLI, SDK, and extensions.

 ## Phase 6: Coverage Monitoring (Sprint 6)
 - **Coverage badge**: Add Codecov badge to README.
 - **Threshold enforcement**: Fail CI if coverage drops below agreed minimum.

 ## Next Steps: Repo Setup
 1. Gather the target remote repository name and owner.
 2. Initialize a new GitHub repo and push this directory as its initial commit.
