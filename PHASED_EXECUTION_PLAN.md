 # Phased Execution Plan

 This document outlines a multi-phase roadmap to implement the audit recommendations in a prioritized manner.

 ## Phase 1: Documentation Consolidation (Sprint 1)
 - **Consolidate READMEs**: Merge duplicate top-level and sub-READMEs into centralized `docs/` directory.
 - **Archive outdated docs**: Move deprecated or overlapping markdown files to an `archive/` folder.
 - **Update references**: Ensure top-level README links point to consolidated docs.

 ## Phase 2: Secret Management & Validation (Sprint 2)
 - **Env var checks**: Add startup validation for required environment variables (`.env`).
 - **Secret linter**: Integrate `secretlint` or equivalent to prevent accidental leak of credentials.

 ## Phase 3: CI/CD Security Enhancements (Sprint 3)
 - **Pin Action versions**: Fix versions for Trivy, Bun setup, and other GH Actions.
 - **Dependency audit**: Add `bun audit` or `npm audit --audit-level=high` step.
 - **Coverage gates**: Enforce minimum coverage thresholds in CI.

 ## Phase 4: Pre-Commit Hooks & Script Linting (Sprint 4)
 - **Pre-commit config**: Introduce `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to run ESLint, Prettier, Shellcheck.
 - **Shellcheck**: Lint all deployment and helper scripts.

 ## Phase 5: Version Management & Releases (Sprint 5)
 - **Lock CI tool versions**: Standardize on tested versions for Bun, GH Actions, Docker base images.
 - **Release process**: Define a uniform release workflow across CLI, SDK, and extensions.

 ## Phase 6: Coverage Monitoring (Sprint 6)
 - **Coverage badge**: Add Codecov badge to README.
 - **Threshold enforcement**: Fail CI if coverage drops below agreed minimum.

 ## Phase 7: AI Orchestrator Enhancement (Sprint 7)
 - **Backend Orchestrator Service**: Define and scaffold a dedicated orchestrator microservice with LLM integration, tooling plugins (memory-client, web search, code analysis).
 - **Plugin Interface**: Build a plugin runner to call memory search, external search, code review, and credential management as tools.
 - **Conversation/Memory Loop**: Implement retrieval-augmented generation when handling chat, with automatic memory creation and recall.

 ## Phase 8: Dashboard & SDK Integration (Sprint 8)
 - **UI Embedding**: Integrate the orchestrator service into the dashboard via a persistent chat panel with session storage.
 - **Toggle & Defaults**: Provide enable/disable switch and auto-load on startup; load API/memory-client config dynamically.
 - **Human Friendly Formatting**: Convert raw JSON or plugin outputs into cards, links, and rich text.

 ## Phase 9: Credential & MCP Tooling (Sprint 9)
 - **Secure Vault**: Build a credential manager UI and backend for API keys, secrets, and automated rotation.
 - **MCP Connector Setup**: Provide one-click MCP server/client configuration flows for VSCode, Cursor, Windsurf.

 ## Phase 10: External Context Plugins (Sprint 10)
 - **Web Search Plugin**: Integrate a web-search API to fetch external documentation and enrich chat context.
 - **Codebase Analysis Plugin**: Enable the orchestrator to consume and reason over the local codebase for live code review.

 ## Phase 11: CI/CD in Fragments (Sprint 11)
 - **Per-Phase Pipelines**: Split CI into discrete workflow fragments corresponding to each Sprint, allowing independent validation and deployment.
 - **Orchestrator Service CI**: Automated build/test/deploy for the orchestrator backend.
 - **Dashboard Integration CI**: End-to-end tests for UI embedding and session persistence.
 - **Plugin Testing CI**: Verification jobs for each tool/plugin (search, code analysis, credential mgmt).

 ## Phase 12: End-to-End Demonstration & Docs (Sprint 12)
 - **Walkthrough Guide**: Publish step-by-step documentation showcasing the orchestrator flow end-to-end.
 - **Usage Examples**: Provide example projects using the SDK, CLI, and dashboard orchestrator.
 - **Release & Rollout**: Tag and release orchestrator and dashboard components as versioned artifacts.
